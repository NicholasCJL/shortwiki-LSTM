chunk:
    [(ndarray) x, (ndarray) y]

x:
    shape: (batch_size, sequence_length, 1)
    e.g. [[[1], [2], [3],...[k]], ...]
    Array of sequences, each sequence is an array of a 1-length vector, each 1-length vector is a character in the time-series

y:
    shape: (batch_size, 1, 1)
    e.g. [[[1]], [[2]], ...]
    Array of single-valued sequences, each sequence is an array of 1 1-length vector, each 1-length vector is the answer to x-time-series
    Single-valued sequences to be converted into array of 1 one-hot vector.
